Need these toolbox's in your Matlab:
Optimization Toolbox
Statistics Toolbox (before 2015a) OR Statistics and machine learning toolbox
Image Processing toolbox
Curve fitting toolbox

Lightspeed Matlab toolbox (this is from GitHub)
Install this and then need a command every time to use: 
OR put it in folder where you are working from (same directory)
https://github.com/tminka/lightspeed




(1) get fileGenerators, Omniglot_JR_ALL2, and processed_data in the same directory.
(2) run downSampleAll.py <filepath to omniglot_JR_ALL2> 
    This will create Downsampled_Omniglot_JR_ALL2
(3) run fileGenerator.py <filepath to Downsampled_Omniglot_JR_ALL2>
	This will add requisite data files to procesesed_data folder
(4) run datasetGenerator.m in matlab
	This will create omniJrRaw.mat
(5) run cleanse.m in matlab
	This will create omniJr.mat

Results of each step
(1) Gets all data/code in one place
(2) Downsamples the images from 600x600 to 105x105
	by scaling the x and y values in the csv files
	and creating a new folder to store these new files.
	This new folder will contain only csv files (no images).
(3) Parses csvs to generate appropriate files. drawings contains
	the x, y positions. images the 105 x 105 binary images. Timing
	the appropriate times. Names hold names of different alphabets.
	Offsets simply for formalities not actually used by model.
(4) Saves json files in a mat file.
(5) Reformats contents of mat file to match those used in BPL.
